## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in helping out! If you'd like to make a change to react-circular-progressbar master, it's preferable to first validate your change by writing what you plan to do in a new [Github issue](https://github.com/kevinsqi/react-circular-progressbar/issues).

To make your own changes:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Go to `/demo` and view the README to see how to run the demo.
3. Make changes to `/src` and they'll be applied immediately to the running demo. You can use this to prototype, but you probably don't need to commit the changes to `/demo` when creating a PR.
4. Add tests for your new changes and make sure they're passing with `yarn test`.
